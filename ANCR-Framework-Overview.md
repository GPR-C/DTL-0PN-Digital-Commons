Abstract  (WiP)

This eLectronic notice and consent specificaiton is apart of the 0PN Decentralized Data Governance framework  in which a data control impact assessemnt is used to determine the type of risk and controls for operational security and stateful privacy.

This technical framework is comprised of 5 specifications and contributes to multiple work efforts, the record fields are from ISO/IEC 29100 Privacy and Security Techniques, which is an open and free ISO/IEC standard and apart of/works with the ISO/IEC 27002 series, 

This specification is designed to support human centric decentralized data Governance for -Business, Legal and Technical interoperability between people and service infrastrucutre governed with digital identity management.
Completing the work derviced from the Kanatara - Consent Receipt specification to scale human consent online with  eNotice and eConsent designed for digital identity governance with international and scalable standards.  

In this regard, the scope of this specification is to outline the framework and point to other laws, standards and specifications that provide the detailed legal to technical policy information requirements required to operate the information structure specified.  Restricting the scope of this document to the technical.

#0PN-Code

The presentation of an 0PN System Architecture requires first a clear and inclusive data control governance privacy risk model, which is inclusive, non-discriminatory, and empowering.

Resultibg propose a trustworthy id system architecture, which address the governance and risk vectors highlighted from a human centric data control perspective. the premise is trustworthy id is achieved through records i control and use then use to engage with 3rd parties. Rather than records that are controlled for me.

Part 1: Governance & Risk

In governance and risk discourse, legal instruments and modelling we identified through our research that a vector of governance - personal data control has largely been missing. As a result the architecture presented first focuses on the control vector of personal data, then applies a privacy risk and security assurance model in accordance with security requirements of this vector.

There are 3 vectors of digital identitifier governance which has different privacy risks and security considerations for trustworthy digital identifier management. These are reflected as 3 modes of operations in a consent receipt wallet.

Personal Data Control - independent of the service provider.

Co-Regulated Data Control - requires distributed data controls and identifier management.

Data Protection - requires centralized data control and federated identity management.

Each vector of data control governance has 3 tiers/levels of digital identifier risk assurance

1.Self asserted - Controller Credential - usable for hyper localized - in person privacy risk assessment

Authoritative - Controller Credential - verified data controller and data protection officer, or company director, in a jurisdiction where privacy is enforced

Assured - Controller - operator of a personal data control (eConsent) code of practice, which in addition to tier 2, is certified and monitored by recognized provider/regulator for a specific set of data control and management practices

Which vector and what tier can be determined with a data control impact assessment. which involves the assessment of who controls a digital identifier, how many parties it is disclosed too, what is the security when disclosed to indicate the scope of privacy risk. WHo is the beneficial owner?

Trustworthy ID System Architecture

Electronic Notice and Consent Governance Architecture is presented here for digital identity management, in which digital identity represents a high risk, alpha surveillance technology.

This technology presents a prevalent security risk in which people are assigned identifiers, referenced as meta-data, which is then surveilled/tracked to observe sentiment and interest. An electronic notice record and consent record receipt can be used to mirror the record of processing and be verified/notarized for it’s further utilitiy as a micro-credential or token.

ZKP can then be used for self-asserting verifiable credentials anonymously, with a 2fN. (Two Factor Notice)

Section Summaries
Section 1: Anchored Notice Record

A key element missing in online only interactions is personal data control transparency, which is implmented in this framework with 2FN, for proof of notice and evidence of informed or knowledgeable consent.   


Section 1:  topics under review
Dynamic Data Controls
Dynamic Fields:
default consent types for the ANCR Record 
Generating a Receipt for another legal justification
generating a receipt under the authority of a) PII Principal, b) PII Controller, c) Both 
Privacy Rights Agreement - Specifying the legal privacy rules according to the jurisdiction 
Jurisdiction of PII principal for determining  rights access.  (right to complain and be heard) 
Adding a notice payload to a consent receipt 
Rendering a receipt to display the proof of notice 
Rendering the receipt to display notification
Rending a receipt for privacy rights access information. 
Default notice rendering
Verifying rights access and performance
 PII Principle is a verified claim when provided by the individual. 
How can this claim be verified
Section 2: Purpose Specification 

In the Consent Receipt v1.2.2 section  focus and discussion on the consent record information structure, utilizing the GDPR an Internationally adopted (ISO 29184) legal processing justification categories

 purpose specification fields (are for the most part the same as v1.1)
 purpose context - legal justification of processing - instance(s) of processing, purpose categories, 
 purpose specification for 6 legal justifications
specifying rights requests and data processing controls
The rights are then listed with the legal justification in the next sections of the receipt.  

The GDPR rights specification are used here for example, as a privacy agreement enforced in many countries it provides the current International standard for privacy rights.  

Note:  A consent receipt can be specified for only one legal justification  and one purpose (or purpose bundle). 

Section 3: Data Control, Protection & Treatment

This section is an expansion of the receipt fields to further specify the scope of the legal processing of personal information for a specified purpose.  Assuring a purpose limitation principle. 

 of Provides the fields for the technical capture of personal data processing, separating storage, access and privacy rights that apply for the specified legal justification and context.

This section focus discussion on.

 additional fields for specifying privacy rights that are available and the scope of permission that are accessible to the PII Principle. 
Consent Grant Conditions
Withdraw Permission for a Consent Grant
Privacy Rights Applicable for this processing context
Notice of Risk and Liabilities Required in place (or in addition) to contract terms or license agreements
Notifications : the required notice, notifications, and disclosures for valid processing. This is a new section, which is in early review and development. 
Privacy/ Security -  Change & Notification Log, required for records of processing, for open, operational and responsive Online privacy notification. 
Section 4:  Code of Conduct & Practice (Optional)

Extending the Privacy Agreement (or legislation) with a technical code of conduct or practice,  which can be notified with a badge and icon,  provide transparency over additional safeguards and measures (aka privacy preserving technology)  that provide additional privacy assurances, in addition to a more streamlined privacy service user experience.

Discussion includes: 

A code of conduct, which extends privacy legislation and is approved by a privacy regulator. 
a code of practice, which extends a specified purpose with additional codified practices which are either specified by the Notice Controller, or with a certified and audited/auditable practice. 

These additional options can be used to bundle like purposes together, specify each purpose for a consistent and standard processing, streamline experiential use by presenting enhanced practices with a valid/authorised badge, icon, or micro-credential. .

Section 5: Field Input Data Field Sources (UNCL)

The specification of the field data for each section will be collated and combined, including the data sources and specified and referenced according to the OECD Guidelines, Standards, regulatory guidance and legislation.

The long term aim of this section is to Unify the Notice Control   Language (UNCL) iterating towards a notice centric Ontology. Mapping privacy agreement vocabularies with the ISO 29100 terms and definitions and W3C Data Privacy Vocabulary, for machine readable semantics. 

Unified fields data - for purpose specification which harmonizes context - for decentralized governance referring to a consent by default status.

There are a number of legal consent types which are required for active state consent transparency and compliance

implied consent - e.g. going to a website 
implicit consent - e.g. through actions that are implicit and indicative of consent expectations
explicit consent - e.g. providing personal information for a legal specified purpose and privacy rights notice (assumes meaningful and informed digital consent)
expressed (or directed) consent - e.g. an explicit consent that is specified by the PII Principal 
altruistic consent - e.g. a consent specified with a code of practice rather that to a specific legal entity (name of controller not necessarily provided)

Sect 1: Generating a Notice Record
Generate a Notice Record,
this is created from the assessing the notice information, presentation, layered information and policy
Generate a  Notice Reciept
once the record is generated assess the record with a conformance profile specified from ISO 29184, or from regulation or international practice
generate receipt, which is a digital twin of the notice record, and include the results from this assessment aimed to  providing rights information and access
Generate a Consent Notice Receipt.
Utilizing the Notice Receipt, specify which rights, and generate a consent notice receipt for the PII Controller,  
Receiving a Consent Notice Reciept
There are multiple ways to source, validate and verify the valid state of privacy signalled with the record and receipt 
All of the technical information and records of processing are linked to the receipt and is usable to automate the response. 




ANCR Record & Blinding Identity Taxonomy for Consent Receipt Identifier Management 

Their are 2 identifiers used in the receipts 

1. is the ANCR Record iD which is anchored to the PII Controller Notice and the PII Principal's capture of the notice (or equivalent) 

2. The Consent receipt iD that is generated when a PII Principle interacts with the notice, context of a sign or notification




Acronyms

BT = Blinding Taxonomy  is a field that is encrypted, and blinded, so as not be available at rest without a key, in this specification, these fields are blinded by the PII Principal’s User Agent. (BUAT)  If these fields are generated by a 3rd party or controller, then this data is not ‘required’ in this is specification.
